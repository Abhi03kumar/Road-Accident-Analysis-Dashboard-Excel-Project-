This project is an interactive dashboard built in MS Excel to analyze road accident data.
It provides insights into casualties by severity, vehicle type, road type, light conditions, and weather factors.
The dashboard helps in understanding accident patterns and can support policymakers in making data-driven road safety improvements.

📊 Key Insights

✔️ 334,145 total casualties analyzed
✔️ Breakdown by severity → Fatal (1.3%), Serious (13.5%), Slight (85.2%)
✔️ Vehicle-wise analysis → Cars (78.5% of cases), Motorcycles, Buses, Trucks, etc.
✔️ Trend Analysis → CY vs PY monthly comparison
✔️ Area-wise impact → Urban vs Rural
✔️ Road & Surface conditions → Carriageways, Roundabouts, Wet/Dry/Snow surfaces
✔️ Light conditions → Daylight vs Darkness
✔️ Interactive filters for accident date, weather, and wind conditions
